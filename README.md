👾 Exploits are puzzles, and I’m here to crack them wide open.

🔍 Obsessed with breaking things to see how they tick — from software vulnerabilities to network defenses.

⚡ Currently building tools that challenge security systems while refining my skills in exploit development and reverse engineering.

💻 If it involves pushing boundaries, I’m all in — whether it’s testing the limits of a system or developing code that walks that fine line.

📡 Reach out if you’ve got a challenge that needs a deep dive or an issue that requires an unconventional solution.

😎 I prefer my code to be efficient, my vulnerabilities deep, and my patches smarter than my exploits.

🧠 Fun fact: I once found an unexpected exploit in a tool I was building — and used it to fix the very issue I was solving.

💻 Always looking for new challenges in the world of security.

🔍 Fun fact: I once used a zero-day vulnerability to demonstrate a proof of concept that exposed a critical flaw in a major framework.
